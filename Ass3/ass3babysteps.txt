step 1: get travel times in a useful internal format. (map) given source and destination find time

step 2: get a set a routes for ships. can i get that in and verify the constraints (which is trave time + layover time)

step 3: graph of the route structure. can i construct the cost fucntion. and write dijkstras algo for that



TravelTimes* needs to be a data structure. he hinted it should be a map (or a map containing a map)



Function that reads in and checks TSV. skip # lines, etc

Pay attention to if ship arrives next day (after 1440 min)
